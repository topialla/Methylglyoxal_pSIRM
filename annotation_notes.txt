Cinnamic acid is again all over the placeâ€¦

3OHB very instable chromatography
Alanine beta 2TMS BP: check with MP!
Urea sometimes looks like it has laben, but it's an overlap with an adjacent peak (left side)
Leucine MP, if 299 is in, peaks are sometimes very broad (likely overlap with Glycerol MP)
Glycerol MP has rather unstable chromatography
Asp 2TMS BP: unstable chromatography
Phenylalanine 1TMS BP shaky chromatography
Ornithine 3TMS shaky
Glycerol-3-phosphate in injection 030, sample 35 and injection 039, sample 17 shaky (strange chromatography)
Fructose 1M 5TMS BP injection 039, sample 17 would have a huge peak
Fructose BP might be also Mannose (quantify mannose on mz 160 Th)
Lysine 4TMS MP shaky from Injection 045 onward
Lactose BP is likely contaminant in 13C glucose samples
Uridine 5P injection 046-056 shaky
